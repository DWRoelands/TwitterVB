TwitterVB
=========

A .NET library for communicating with Twitter

I stopped maintaining this library in 2011.  Since then, Twitter has made changes to their API, and TwitterVB no longer works

I am leaving the source code here on GitHub in case someone else would like to use it in their own projects.

I suspect that a sharp developer could get the library working in less than a day's time.  :)
