TwitterVB
=========

A .NET library for communicating with Twitter

This library has been updated to work with version 1.1 of the Twitter API.  Please be aware that this version of the
library should be considered "pre-release" as I have not done any testing on it.  This library is still not being
actively maintained in any significant way.

I will do my best to make sure that it continues to function, but there are no plans to enhance it or add features.
